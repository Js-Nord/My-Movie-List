# My-Movie-List
Creates a ranking list of your favourite movies using Flask, WTForms, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap and TMDB API.

You will need DB Browser for SQLlite to create and open the new table in the database. 

Once you run the code, you will be able to add movies, rate them, update the rating and review and delete them from your list. 

The ranking is based on the rating you have given each movie, and will be shown from least rated to most rated.
